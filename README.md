No third party API, just detects current applications playing audio & retrieves song information from the title.
You can try passing the output to any free music database to retrieve album art & other info.

Currently works with Spotify, VLC, Foobar, Chrome & Firefox (youtube video). Its pretty easy to add more players, have a look at the code.
